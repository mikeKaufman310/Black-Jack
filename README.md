I am bored, so I am making this black jack web app

todo:
- figure out ide package things/bug
- finish shuffle in deck
- implement game logic
- make rest endpoints for game logic
- make js frontend logic
- make web frontend
- use ngrok or something to host both back and front ends
- get money

running it:
backend => run "make", run "make run"
frontend => use liveserver to host index.html and associated scripts
